you should always sanitize superglobals before using them. One way to do
this is via the PHP htmlentities function. It converts all characters into HTML entities.
For example, less-than and greater-than characters (< and >) are transformed into the
strings &lt;  and &gt;  so that they are rendered harmless, as are all quotes and back‚Äê
slashes, and so on.
Therefore, a much better way to access $_SERVER (and other superglobals) is:
$came_from = htmlentities($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']);
